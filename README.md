# LC-Form-Basics

This is just a quick example of how you can use the DOM with forms for a dynamic user experience. The page is empty at first, except for a toggle for a form to enter a day of the week, category, and activity. The JS code then puts the new entry on the page under the correct day of the week header (created with the first entry for that day) and tags it with a color-coded label for the category.
